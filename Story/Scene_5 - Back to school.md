## Coming Back to School Scene
  
  
The day have been fairly decent so far. Yeah, this may be a pretty good day. The perfect day to become the last of my life.  
 
I made my way through the halls, doing my best to avoid any confrontation. As I came into the class, I was quickly pushed to the back of the class by one of the football team's thugs. She shoved me against the wall. But this time, there was something different on me. I didn't show any pain, not even curled deeper into myself. Why? Does it actually matter? All the pain will go away very soon anyway.  
 
"What's up with you, bitch? Aren't you going to cry as usual?" she spat, literally spat. I didn't bother to bring my hand to my face to wipe the disgusting liquid off. She punched me in the stomach, intensifying my pain. I sat there, on the hard cold floor, in silence as the football player left chatting excitedly with her mates, not before bringing her hand down painfully hard on the back of my head. I wanted so badly to yell at her. Keeping all that fury inside me was driving me crazy but that would only make it worse.  
 
I was unable to pay attention to the teacher. I was nervous and quite tense. It was raining heavily outside. The sound of drops landing in the windows of the room reminded me that my life is like a dessert and I'm terribly thirsty for love, but I know it will never rain again. Although there was a time when the rain fell in abundance. I began to remember that time, the memories of the years I spent with my former friends. "How did I end up alone?" I asked myself. Some drifted apart because I didn't want to get together with the most popular blokes. Others because I did not want to dress like a feminine girl. And the rest due to a false rumour, they thought that I had an affair with my best friend's boyfriend. After that incident, they all put me aside. That rumour destroyed savagely any owned friendship as fire that consumes life.  
 
As the clock showed it was time for the lunch break, I knew it was time. I turned my eyes upon the group of posh vipers, to give them a last conspiratorial look, so they know who were the main originators of the approaching tragedy. "Who does she think she is looking at us?" the tallest of the group said when she noticed my presence. I've got a simple answer to that: I think I am nobody.
