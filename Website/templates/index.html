        <p>I sat at the back of the bus with my forehead pressed against the window, hoping that they wouldn't be here today. As the bus pulled up to its final stop, I realised that I would be as unlucky today as I was every other day of my pathetic life. Why should today be any different, even if it is my birthday? That's right. Today should be my special day, but I don't expect nothing else than the "warm" affection of my peers and mother.</p>
        <p>I knew the moment they found me hidden in the very last seat on the school bus that it was going to be worse than in the past few days. They hate it when I try to hide…</p>
        <p>One of my classmates approached me. "How is it going, dyke?" he said. He spat the last word as if it were poison on his tongue. I chose to ignore him, knowing it would only irritate him, not really caring at the moment.</p>
        <p>"I'm talking to you, chick!" he glared fiercely at me. I don't know what I ever did to him, but apparently it was enough to make him hate me for life. He suddenly started smacking me, tangling up and yanking on my long hair. I held back the tears and bit my tongue imploring I would get to school sooner rather than later. I wished the day would already end.</p>
        <p>The toxic sound of his friends laughing and applauding him for his actions reverberated in my ears as the school came into view. "Just another day in hell" I thought to myself. My life is indeed far from paradise. As I was leaving the bus, I received a look of pity from the middle-aged bus driver, but I already knew no one would ever speak of the things they were doing to me. No one. At some moment in my past, I thought that while growing up everything would be great. All that hope has been shattered over time. Everyone around me is out to get me, trying to hurt me, whishing I was dead. Is that the only truth?</p>
        <p>And the day was just beginning.</p>

        <p>Once in the classroom, I made my way as quickly as possible to the site in the farthest corner from the entrance. I looked on in disgust as slags flirted shamelessly, practically showing their… you know… personal areas… while bending over the boys' desks in their diminutive skirts. I rolled my eyes at the most popular group of popular girls at school. "Don't you think her clothes are ugly?" I overhead from Angela, their leader or as I like to call her, the queen bee. It's no surprise. I know that they constantly criticise how weird my long hair is or how stupid my smart-ass questions are. My classmates don't really get me. For them, talking to me would mean committing social suicide. I know my body and face aren't really attractive, but is it such an issue?</p>
        <p>The teacher finally entered the room and started writing out today's assignment on the board. "I hate history" I whispered. It doesn't matter what era it is, I simply hate it. I prefer to write. Writing diaries is the only way I can escape, get all my feelings out of me before they drive me insane. They are the only friends I can share my daily experiences with. Classes finally concluded and as the clock struck five, a wolf pack noisily plodded out of the corridors yearning to meet their beloved families. Little they know how solitary my meaningless insignificant life was at home.</p>
        <p>I was so lost in my own little world that when a finger poked my shoulder, I jumped up and gave a little shriek. I turned with my face as red as it could get showing how abashed I was, and there she was, my science teacher Miss. Blanchard, gazing at me with a small smile. "Hi, love. I've noticed you were a bit lost in thoughts during the class. Are you feeling alright? Would you like to talk with me about anything that upsets you… home or maybe the kids in class?" she said. In that instant, I heard a voice inside me shouting desperately and begging for its release. That voice was eager to be manifested among those walls, longing to find understanding and consolation on that teacher. But I killed it. I smiled sheepishly. "No, everything is fine" I responded. Because I already knew what would come next: a sudden beating by the "Gods" of the school for being a snitch. I am just frightened, frightened of feeling more pain. I want everyone to leave me alone.</p>
        <p>"You know you can tell me anything that disturbs you, right?" she stated. I nodded, rushed to pack my notebooks and quickly left the room heading towards my locker to pick up some books and return to what I unfortunately called home.</p>

        <p>The class was practically empty and Miss Margaret approached me after collecting her belongings on the desk.</p>
        <p>"Rapunzel, I know something's up. You have been extremely quiet and lost in thoughts during class. Tell me what's going on. Please." she said. Damn it! The last thing I wished was for my teacher to get in the way. I did not want the school to know anything about what I was planning to do. I did not want it to get in trouble, only its students. I wanted to teach them a lesson and stop this from happening to any innocent teenager in the future. "I'm okay, Miss Blanchard. It's nothing you should worry about." I responded with a guilty voice making clear that I was hiding a secret.</p>
        <p>"All right… At least take this note with my phone number on it to call me whenever you want and to chat with me about whatever you need." she said while writing her phone number on a piece of paper that she took out of her handbag. She handed me the note and I took it showing a forced smile. She said goodbye and left the classroom, and I sighed with relief. I couldn't wait to kill myself in the toilet. I had to do it at that moment, in that room. I could not allow another person to prevent me from achieving happiness. If there is no way to find happiness in this life, I will find it in the next.</p>
        <p>I couldn't bear it. I took the knife from my backpack. But as I was raising the knife towards my throat, I started shivering. Little by little the movement was slowing down until a strange feeling didn't permit my body to carry on. Snatching life is an act of courage and I am no one. I am weak, inferior. However, there are people who care about me out there: my dear grandma Ella, auntie Amelia and my cousins, Jessica, Jack and Oliver. Even though they live far away, they still feel affection for me. Then what the hell am I doing if I have people who still love and would mourn me? I dropped the knife as if it were acid, fell to my knees and burst into tears.</p>
        <p>Warm tears, as bright as a diamond, slid down my cheek and a thumb came from nowhere to wipe them away. I sat up straight and opened my eyes to see Miss. Margaret Blanchard beside me with a concerned look on her face. What was she doing there?</p>
        <p>"Don't cry, my love, don't cry. I'm here. Everything will be alright" she whispered in my ear while stroking my head.</p>
        <p>"I knew something wasn't right, that's why I waited outside until I heard you sobbing. But what on the Earth were you thinking to do with that knife? Sweet heart, it is normal to feel lonely and to cry. Adults also cry, constantly." she reproached me. "Please, Rapunzel, say something." she implored after a few endless seconds of pure silence. I was shocked. I was stuttering and struggled much to finish the first sentence. With a little more fluency, I addressed her explaining that I wanted to keep this secret from the rest of teachers and the director. "I respect your decision to keep this private, but your mother has to know what has happened today. Maybe I'm not the most appropriate person to help you overcome your depression, but I know who can help you better." she said. Then she took her mobile phone and began to dial a number. "But only if you are willing to take the first step." she concluded waiting for a gesture of affirmation from me.</p>
        <p>I sighted and looked up at her, looking directly into her eyes. I grasped her phone with an overwhelming determination and decided to open up to the help centre. For the first time, I was willing to seek help.</p>

        <p>I curled up into a small ball on my bed and tears flowed freely. I know I shouldn't be hurt that everyone refuses to talk to me. After my own friends put me aside, it really shouldn't surprise me. But it does hurt, it hurts like hell. Once the tears ran out, I closed my eyes attempting to forget. When I opened them, it was already daytime. I was standing in front of a picture window. I was perplexed. I realised I was no longer in my little room in my house. There were enthralling views of a green meadow from the construction where I was and I could smell the sweet scent of jasmine from the distance. I noticed that there was not a single door in that room and I looked over the edge of the window amazed by the vertiginous height. "There I was isolated from the rest of the world at the top of a tower" I thought, accepting the situation comically. Coming out of nowhere, a hand grabbed my torso and dragged me away from the window. I tried to resist, but several hands appeared to suppress me. The hands did not seem to be connected to any particular body, they were incomprehensibly suspended in the air. While doing my best to escape, I started to hear voices calling me. Those voices repeated my name over and over again as if they wanted to own me. I managed to break free and ran towards the large window. I leapt from the tower trying to break out of that distressing prison. I could feel an intense draught caressed my body as I was falling. Everything happened so quickly, it was the first second of my life in which I finally felt truly free. And then darkness came, an absolute and perfect darkness. There were no angry mothers or aggressive schoolmates there, only tranquillity, silence and peace.
        </p>
        <p>Suddenly I woke up with my eyes shooting open. I was sweating and it took me a moment to realise where I was. My heart was pounding. Everything had been a mere nightmare. But had it actually been a nightmare or a sweet dream? Reliving what happened in my fantasy, I was quite satisfied with the ending. I felt happy, liberated when I jumped from the tower. Without any warning, a revelation came to my mind. What if there was an alternative, a solution for all the pain that I was feeling in my heart? Maybe some pills? A knife? A bridge? What would be the fastest way to end my life? All of them are good ways to end a life that is destined to end after all. That is, we will end up dying someday. Why not making the outcome come ahead of time? Would I matter to anyone once I'm no longer in this world, even to my relatives that live far away?</p>
        <p>Why not committing the suicide at school, in the toilets, for example? A place where the whole school will be able to gaze at my cold, lifeless body lying on the floor like an empty shell. Then they will realise their mistake. In this way, I will not pass away in vain and my life would have a purpose: to make those bullies realise the damage they cause and to trigger a change in their attitudes. No other student will suffer what I have been through.</p>
        <p>"Happy Birthday…" I said with a sad voice that seemed to break at any time. I did not want to miss the opportunity to congratulate myself, as this will surely be my last birthday.</p>

        <p>It was a cold winter afternoon and as soon as I entered the reception, I felt the cosy heat of the radiator in my shivery body. I addressed the receptionist, greeted her and asked her for directions to Dr Sophie Hopper's office. She indicated the direction and told me the room number so I wouldn't get lost. I knocked on the door and one second later heard a voice saying "Come in!". I was feeling quite uneasy, had only talked to that person over the phone, but never face to face.</p>
        <p>A beautiful woman with very long lashes like the eyes of a doll and a slender figure welcomed me from her desk. "Hi, Rapunzel. I'm Sophie. Nice to meeting you in person! You are a very pretty girl, you know?" she said. I responded with a friendly greeting as well. I took off all the unnecessary warm clothes and settled in to the comfortable swivel chair positioned next to Sophie's desk. I took a brief look at the ceiling. Her room was really commodious and had many awards and degrees on the wall.</p>
        <p>"How do you feel, darling?" she asked. "I'm okay… well, sometimes I feel huge regret for all those years lost in the pain caused by all the abuse you already know about. But other than that, I feel good." I answered thinking thoroughly what to say. Now that I realised, it has been 2 months since the first time I talked to Sophie. I believe it was the longest call of my whole life. I recalled explaining to her that the issue wasn't just the verbal, physical and mental abuse. All my self-respect and confidence had been taken away. I didn't believe in myself and was afraid I was never going to be the same again. I didn't know what was wrong with me. But now all those negative feelings has disappeared into oblivion.</p>
        <p>Sophie congratulated me on how quickly I had improved and resumed her interrogation. "And your mother? How is she? Has she done anything violent since we contacted her?" she asked me with special attention. That query made me think about how much my mother had changed after Margaret discussed with her about my almost-suicide. Sophie informed me about a week ago that if she continued with her usual behaviour from 2 months ago, the judge would surely deprive her of my guardianship. She added that, in that case, they will have to ask to my closest relative to become the legal guardian. I would not mind living with my grandmother's house for a while, but I do not want to leave my mother alone either. I hope that with time, we will get to understand each other. Our current relationship is quite neutral, she does not hit me but she does not give me any compliments or provide me whims and caresses. Apparently she cares about me after all. I'm quite confident our relationship will improve over time. Thanks to Sophie, I am now more optimistic than ever.
        </p>
        <p>"And with Miss Blanchard? Have you chatted recently in class?" the psychologist wondered. I nodded my head feeling truly shy. I remember with tenderness and affection the time with Miss Blanchard after hanging up the phone that infamous day. I spent two hours in the classroom, holding both of her hands as I told her about the last few days, about how I felt, what I thought, what I went through... It was touching, she behaves like a real mother with me. She is without a doubt a delightful woman.</p>
        <p>"We want you to find a family, a home where you feel at ease, so if you feel unhappy about anything, come to this office and we'll chat for as long as it takes" Dr Hopper commented. "I have wonderful news to tell you, Rapunzel" she announced. I remained expectant with my eyes wide open, waiting anxiously to hear the news. "With the permission and legal agreement of your mother, we have transferred you to another institution where you will start studying next term!" the therapist stated vigorously. I was stunned. Will I really have the opportunity to start over? Will I be able to make new friends there? I immediately jumped out of the chair to hug Sophie and give her my most heartfelt gratitude.</p>
        <p>This may be the end of the beatings, insults and bullying that brought so much sadness and despair to my life. But it is also the beginning of a beautiful life where the help of others is there when you need it the most. I may be changing schools but I will never forget Margaret Blanchard. She will always hold a special place in my heart. She will always be my hero, my angel, my saviour.</p>
