6. She's starting self-harming.  

7. Teacher confronts Rapunzel again after noticing her bruises and cuts during one of the classes.   

8. Rapunzel feels that the teacher knows what is happening with her, she feels that she need to share her story to avoid another confrontation and so the teacher does not contact her mother.
